# JTCS - Art Gallery

Journal to Canvas Slideshow (Now renamed to "JTCS - Art Gallery") has received a major overhaul and several big feature updates.

In addition to big updates to the core features, and major QOL improvements, the biggest new feature is called the "Art Gallery" which allows you to display multiple different images on multiple different "Art Tiles" in the same scene, bound by "Frame Tiles" that keep the Art Tiles scaled within a certain size.

Here is a video demonstration:

Note: While the wooden scene background and overlay art is included as part of the module in a compendium pack, the tabletop "trinket" assets seen in above video are NOT included as part of the module. They are by [Joe Neeves (Limonium) on Gumroad](https://limonium.gumroad.com/?recommended_by=library).

## Features and Changelog

A detailed walkthrough of the new features can be found here: [Features and Walkthrough](features-and-walkthrough.md)

Major feature additions and improvements are as follows:

### **IMPROVED** 

-   Improved image-share controls in actor, item, and journal sheets
    -   Various Display methods can be easily accessed and activated by hovering over an image and clicking on one of these controls, rather than having to change the method via settings
    -   the Original "click on an image to display it on the canvas" functionality remains intact.

### **NEW**

-   Gallery Tiles
    -   "Gallery Tiles" feature introduced, allowing the creation of "Art Tiles" and "Frame Tiles" (which are an overhauled and much more robust version of the old 'Display Tiles' and 'Bounding Tiles' feature)
    -   Gallery Tiles can be created, linked, configured, and given unique names in a new configuration application called the "Scene Gallery Config"
-   Settings and Customization
    -   JTCS Art Gallery Settings application that can be launched from multiple locations and includes several customization options
    -   colored overlays are shown on tiles on the canvas whenever you hover a connected UI item, to ensure you can easily find them.
        -   overlay colors are customizable
    -   Color customization of elements UI in JTCS Art Gallery apps, including a default light and dark theme.
-   Compendiums
    -   Compendium pack of macros with featuring utilities to make moving and scaling tiles easier
    -   Compendium pack of premade scenes displaying demo setups of Gallery tiles, including a scene meant to act as your default "Display Scene"
    -   Compendium pack of Journal Entries including a scene meant to act as your default "Display Journal"

Thanks to everyone, both users and contributers, for being patient with me as this project has evolved.
